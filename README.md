# Blockchain-simulator-exe
This is a little blockchain(similar to bitcoin right now) for educational purpose by Dr. PEI YAOYAO
## Introduction
* hash algrithom: Double hash256
* encryption: ECDSA, p2ksh, p2sh might be pissibe later
* consensus rule : proof of works
* wallet: dosenot include HD wallet 
* peer type : all full peers, spv might be possible later
* smart contract: might be possible later

## Basic rule

**Firsty,12 peers join the game. Everyone got 1000 yuan at the beginning. 1 yuan = 10 jiao = 100 fen. fen is the minimum monetary unit. The buttons are "Make random transaction","Reach one consusens","Make one specific transastions", "reach five consensus","add one peer into network",and "quit".Try hover mouse on the buttons and heros, u got tips.**

## Source code

**The source codes will be open lattely. Plz wait a sec if you are interested.**

## Let's get started
